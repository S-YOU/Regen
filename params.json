{"name":"Regen","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nRegen is Regular Expression Generator, Compiler, Engine.\r\n\r\nfor fast regular expression matching, Regen uses JIT-compilation\r\n(regular expression -> DFA -> native code). JIT features only works on x86/64 (require Xbyak jit library).\r\nand, Regen can execute matching as data-parallel (require boost::thread).\r\n\r\n### How to Install\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd path_to_regen/src\r\nand build Regen\r\n$ make all\r\nif you don't need JIT/Parallel matching features, you could build like below\r\n$ make REGEN_ENABLE_PARALLEL=no\r\n$ make REGEN_ENABLE_XBYAK=no REGEN_ENABLE_XBYAK=no\r\nto try test and some simple benchmarks,\r\n$ make test\r\n$ make benchmark\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nRyoma Sin'ya (@sinya8282)","tagline":"regular expression generator, engine, jit-compiler","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
